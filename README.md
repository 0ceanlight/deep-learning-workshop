# Deep Learning Workshop

This beginner-level workshop should provide you with the basic knowledge needed to get started creating neural networks with PyTorch. In this tutorial, we train a basic classifier network to recognize images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.

Shoutout to STLCC for hosting this workshop!

## Usage instructions
Use any tutorial to set up Jupyter Notebooks on your system. Then, simply open up `pytorch-mnist.ipynb` and follow along!

If you get stuck anywhere, I've also included a `pytorch-mnist-solution.ipynb` file that contains the completed code.

You can also just view the notebook contents and code output in `pytorch-mnist-solution.html` or `pytorch-mnist-solution.pdf`.
